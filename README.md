The AI-Powered Personalized Learning Assistant is a MERN stack-based project that generates custom quizzes using DeepSeek R1 (running locally via Ollama). Users enter a topic, and the AI creates multiple-choice questions with answers, providing an interactive learning experience. The React frontend allows users to take quizzes, while the Express.js backend communicates with DeepSeek R1 for AI-driven content generation. This project offers local AI processing, reducing API costs, and can be extended with user authentication, progress tracking, and scoring systems for a fully adaptive learning platform.
